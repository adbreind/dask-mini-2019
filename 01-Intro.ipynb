    "### About Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask was created in 2014 as part of the Blaze project, a DARPA funded project at Continuum/Anaconda. It has since grown into a multi-institution community project with developers from projects including NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter and Scikit-Learn. Many of the core Dask maintainers are employed to work on the project by companies including Continuum/Anaconda, Prefect, NVIDIA, Capital One, Saturn Cloud and Coiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, Dask allows a variety of parallel workflows using existing Python constructs, patterns, or libraries, including dataframes, arrays (scaling out Numpy), bags (an unordered collection construct a bit like `Counter`), and `concurrent.futures`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to working in conjunction with Python ecosystem tools, Dask's extremely low scheduling overhead (nanoseconds in some cases) allows it work well even on single machines, and smoothly scale up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask supports a variety of use cases for industry and research: https://stories.dask.org/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "With its recent 2.x releases, and integration to other projects (e.g., RAPIDS for GPU computation), many commercial enterprises are paying attention and jumping in to parallel Python with Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dask Ecosystem__\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the core Dask library and its Distributed scheduler, the Dask ecosystem connects several additional initiatives, including...\n",
    "* Dask ML - parallel machine learning, with a scikit-learn-style API\n",
    "* Dask-kubernetes\n",
    "* Dask-XGBoost\n",
    "* Dask-YARN\n",
    "* Dask-image\n",
    "* Dask-cuDF\n",
    "* ... and some others\n",
    "\n",
    "__What's Not Part of Dask?__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of functions that integrate to Dask, but are not represented in the core Dask ecosystem, including...\n",
    "\n",
    "* a SQL engine\n",
    "* data storage\n",
    "* data catalog\n",
    "* visualization\n",
    "* coarse-grained scheduling / orchestration\n",
    "* streaming\n",

    "__Schedulers and Clustering__\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask has a simple default scheduler called the \"single machine scheduler\" -- this is the scheduler that's used if your `import dask` and start running code without explicitly using a `Client` object. It can be handy for quick-and-dirty testing, but I would (*warning! opinion!*) suggest that a best practice is to __use the newer \"distributed scheduler\" even for single-machine workloads__\n",
